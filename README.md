## Autonomous vehicles

1-week intensive course on autonomous vehicles at [ENSTA](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/en/discover-ensta/overview).
Together with [Nicolas Cadhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-cadart-4119b1129/?ppe=1), we obtained the maximum grade.
The assignments are the property of the teacher [Cem Karaoguz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cem-karaoguz-50274434/?ppe=1), but our solutions are free to use.

The goal was to explore a few topics in intelligent vehicles such as best path planning, detection of traffic lights, Lidar data processing (detection of surroundings) and machine learning analysis.
